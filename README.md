This is the repository, where I will be implementing
and playing around with algorithms learnt in the *algorithms & datastructures* lectures.

## Introduction Algorithms
- Karatsuba and Ofman
- Pasture Break
- Star Search (using graphs)
- Maximum Subarray Sum

## Searching & Sorting Algorithms (list)
- Binary Search

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## DP Algorithms
- Fibonacci


## Search Algorithms (graph)
using an own implementation of Graphs
### in unweighted graphs:
- DFS: Test Reachability
- BFS: Test Reachability, Shortest Path Algorithm

### in weighted graphs:
- Dijkstra: Shortest Path Algorithm
- Bellman Ford: Shortest Path Algorithm
