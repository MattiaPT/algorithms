This is the repository, where I will be implementing
and playing around with algorithms learnt in the *algorithms & datastructures* lectures.

## Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

## Search Algorithms
### in unweighted graphs:
- DFS: Test Reachability, (in progress)
- BFS: Test Reachability, Shortest Path Algorithm, (in progress)

### in weighted graphs:
- Dijkstra (shortest path algorithm)
- (in progress)
